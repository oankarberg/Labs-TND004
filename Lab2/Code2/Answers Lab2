You make individual comparison for each item in all the items. 
That makes the probability go up by exponential times.

So if we check the probability of that 2 people out of 20 has the same birthday we first count the probability of 2 persons has different birhdays. 

Different birthdays probability is 364 / 365 = 0.997260

We have 20*19 / 2 = 190 pairs/combinations.

This gives us the probability of different birthdays for all the 190 pairs: 

(364/365)^190 = 0.5938

Chance of having the same birthdays is 1 - 0.5938 = 40.62%

The collision is the same when trying to insert a key in a hashTable. The probability is although not the same.
