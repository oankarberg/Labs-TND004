You are requested to estimate the running time of the following statements. Use Big-Oh
notation and motivate clearly your answers.
 Set<T> S(V, n); -- where V is an array with n objects of type T.
 S1 = S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.
 S.cardinality(); -- where S is a Set.
 S1 <= S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.

 S1 + S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.
 k+S; -- where S is a Set of elements of a type T (e.g. int) and k is a value of
type T (e.g. constant 5).
Remember to write your answers in paper, preferably computer typed, and do not forget to
indicate the name plus LiU login of each group member. Deliver your written answers to
the lab assistant, when you present the lab

Estimation of running times Lab 1
1. Set<T> S(V, n); -- where V is an array with n objects of type T.
  - Should be O(n), since we loop and store values in the Set.

2. S1 = S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.
  - Should be O(n) since we loop through set by clearing and inserting

3. S.cardinality(); -- where S is a Set.
  - Should be O(1), only comparing 2 values

4. S1 <= S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.
  - Should be O(n) , looping over sets to see if S1 is subset.

5. S1 + S2; -- where S1 and S2 are two Sets.
  - Should be O(n) , looping and adding set

6.
